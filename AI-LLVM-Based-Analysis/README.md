# AI-Based LLVM-Style Compiler Analysis

Modern compilers like LLVM use AI and machine learning
to analyze intermediate representations (IR) and guide
optimization decisions.

In this project, an AI-based analysis inspired by LLVM
ML-driven optimization techniques was applied to the
virtual compiler.

The AI tool was used to:
- Analyze three-address intermediate code
- Detect redundant temporaries
- Validate optimization correctness
- Verify phase-wise execution flow

This demonstrates AI-assisted compiler analysis as
used in modern compiler infrastructures.
