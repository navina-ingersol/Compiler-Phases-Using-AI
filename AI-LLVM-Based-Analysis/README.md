# AI-Based LLVM-Style Compiler Analysis

Modern compilers such as LLVM use AI and machine learning
techniques to analyze intermediate representations (IR)
and guide optimization decisions.

In this project, an AI-based analysis approach inspired by
LLVM ML-based optimization techniques was applied to the
virtual compiler.

The AI tool was conceptually used to:
- Analyze intermediate code representations
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Validate phase-wise execution flow of the compiler

This demonstrates the role of AI in modern compiler design
without requiring full LLVM infrastructure.
