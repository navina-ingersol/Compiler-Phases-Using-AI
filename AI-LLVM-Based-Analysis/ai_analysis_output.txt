LLVM-Style AI Compiler Analysis Report

Input: Intermediate Code from Phase 4

t1 = c * d
t2 = b + t1
a = t2

AI Analysis Results:
- Detected redundant temporary variable: t2
- Suggested optimization: eliminate t2
- Optimized form preserves semantic correctness
- Target code mapping is valid

Conclusion:
The compiler pipeline follows standard LLVM-style IR
analysis and optimization principles.
