LLVM-Style AI Compiler Analysis Report:

- Intermediate code is represented in three-address form
- Redundant temporary variables were detected
- Optimization opportunities identified (temporary elimination)
- Target code mapping preserves semantic correctness

The compiler pipeline follows standard LLVM-style design principles.
