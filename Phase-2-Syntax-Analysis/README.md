Phase 2 – Syntax Analysis
Overview
This phase implements Syntax Analysis for a simplified C language.
The parser validates the grammatical structure of the source program using tokens generated by the lexical analyzer.

Files Included
parser.cpp – Implements the syntax analyzer (Phase 2)

lexer.cpp – Lexical analyzer reused from Phase 1 to generate tokens

How It Works
Source code is read from standard input.

The lexical analyzer (lexer.cpp) scans the input and produces tokens.

The parser (parser.cpp) consumes the token stream and checks it against grammar rules.

Syntax errors are reported if the input does not follow the grammar.
