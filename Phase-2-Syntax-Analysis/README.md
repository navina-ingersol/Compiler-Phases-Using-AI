# Phase 2: Syntax Analysis

Syntax Analysis is the second phase of a compiler.
It checks whether the sequence of tokens follows grammatical rules.

Input (from Phase 1):
KEYWORD IDENTIFIER OPERATOR NUMBER

Example Statement:
int a = 10;

Result:
Syntax is valid.

This phase verifies the structure of the program before semantic checks.
