# Virtual Compiler Using AI

This repository implements a virtual compiler by simulating
all six phases of compilation using AI tools and C programs.

Phases implemented:
1. Lexical Analysis
2. Syntax Analysis
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Intermediate Code Generation
5. Code Optimization
6. Target Code Generation

Each phase is implemented in a separate folder with input,
output, source code, and explanation.

## AI in Compiler Design

Apart from implementing all six compiler phases,
an AI-based LLVM-style analysis layer was integrated.

This AI layer analyzes intermediate representations,
identifies optimization opportunities, and validates
the correctness of the compiler pipeline.
