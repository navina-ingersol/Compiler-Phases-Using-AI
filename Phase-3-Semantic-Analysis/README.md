# Phase 3: Semantic Analysis

Semantic Analysis is the third phase of a compiler.
It checks whether the program is logically correct.

Input (from Syntax Analysis):
KEYWORD IDENTIFIER OPERATOR NUMBER

Example Statement:
int a = 10;

Checks Performed:
- Variable is declared
- Data types are compatible

Output:
Semantic Analysis Successful

This phase ensures correctness of meaning before code generation.
